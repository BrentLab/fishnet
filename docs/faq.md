[comment]: # TODO: FAQs about FISHNET algorithm and running the package

### The code has an option for providing a conda environment. Where can I find the required packages?
We provide a YAML file in the FISHNET [GitHub](https://github.com/BrentLab/fishnet/blob/main/conf/fishnet_conda_environment.yml).

### Can you prepare a single notebook containing all scripts and data that one can open and run?
Unfortunately, FISHNET is currently written as a mix of several languages, so
this makes preparing a "single notebook" not an easy task.
